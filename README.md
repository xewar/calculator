A colorful calculator. View the live project [here](https://xewar.github.io/calculator/).

This project helped me feel more comfortable with loops, string and array methods, as well as event listeners and their interactions. So far one of the things I like about programming is that there are many different ways to approach and solve a problem, with more and less elegant solutions. It reminds me of an Ewe proverb - "Adaata so ha, me lo eme.
Although the grass looks even, there are paths in between." Source: http://afriprov.org/images/afriprov/books/ewe100proverbs.pdf Cephas Yao Agbemenu, the person who compiled these proverbs, offers the meaning as "every problem has a way of solving it," and "all people are not the same." I like this second interpretation that alludes to the existence of multiple possibilities.

Things that I learned or got a lot of practice with on this project:
    + How to make functions work with both clicks on buttons and keyboard shortcuts
    + When and why to use splice versus slice versus pop
    + Debugging and reworking code as the project grew in complexity

Things that were hardest to figure out or get right:
    + how the delete button would work
    + how the calculate function would work. Specifically, how to iterate over and reduce an array of numbers and math symbols following the order of operations, as well as how to account for negative numbers. What ended up helping was writing some pseudocode that broke the problem into smaller steps.

Future add-ons:
    + Better functionality to deal with large numbers: text wrapping and an expanding display.

Other thoughts:
    + It'll be great to learn how to incorporate Creative Suite type tools into my workflow. But it was also sort of fun to go back to the basics and design with the limitations of my knowledge of CSS.
